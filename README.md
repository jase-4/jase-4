# 👋 Hi, I’m Jase Branch

🛠️ I'm a systems-focused developer interested in embedded programming, real-time graphics, and autonomous systems.  
🎓 B.S. in Computer Science (2024), incoming M.S. in CS at Oregon State University (Fall 2025)  
🚁 Currently building a drone simulator from scratch using C++, OpenGL, Ada, and Bullet Physics.

## 🧠 Interests
- Embedded systems (STM32, FreeRTOS, sensor fusion)
- GPU programming (CUDA, OpenMP, OpenGL)
- Systems programming (C++, Ada, Rust, Bash)
- Static site generation & tooling (Lua, CI/CD, minimal web)
- Simulation, autonomy, and flight control logic

---

## 🔭 Projects
- **🛰️ Autonomous Drone Simulator** – sensor emulation, virtual flight controller, UDP/MQTT comms  
- **🧠 GPU Boid Flocking** – real-time CUDA + OpenGL sim of swarm behavior  
- **🕹️ OpenGL Renderer** – ECS-based 3D engine with shaders, shadows, OBJ loading  
- **🔌 Embedded Sensor Fusion** – real MPU-6050 data over Wi-Fi with STM32 + ESP8266  
- **📝 Custom Static Site Generator** – lightweight Lua-based generator with markup parser
